# World Bank Project: Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)

## Overview
The ETL process, which stands for Extract, Transform, Load, involves working with two core datasets from the World Bank:

1. **World Bank Indicator Data:** This dataset encompasses socio-economic indicators across various countries.
2. **World Bank Project Data:** A comprehensive compilation of information regarding World Bank project lending dating back to 1947.

## Project Outline
### Extract
The data is extracted from diverse sources, including CSV files, JSON files, and APIs. This stage involves acquiring data from different platforms to ensure a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

### Transform
The transformation phase is critical and involves various operations:
- **Combining Sources:** Merging data from disparate sources to create a cohesive dataset.
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressing issues such as data types, date parsing, file encodings, missing data, duplicates, outliers, and more.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new variables and scaling features to enhance the dataset's predictive power.
- **ETL Pipeline:** Coding an ETL pipeline to systematically perform these transformations.

### Load
The transformed and integrated dataset is loaded into a new database for easier access and analysis.

### ETL Pipeline
An ETL pipeline will be developed in Python to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading processes. This pipeline aims to streamline the entire data processing workflow, making it efficient and reproducible.

## Objective
The primary goal of this notebook is to amalgamate multiple datasets to facilitate the creation of a machine learning model. The objective is to predict the total costs associated with World Bank projects. However, this task involves multiple complexities and challenges.

## Notebook Content
This notebook details the intricate process of transforming and consolidating diverse datasets into a unified and enriched form. It covers various transformation techniques, merging methodologies, and cleaning procedures necessary to harmonize the data effectively.

At the conclusion of this notebook, an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline will be constructed. This pipeline will be capable of extracting data from different sources, transforming it as needed, and loading the processed data into a new database. Additionally, a Python module will be developed to automate the entire data processing pipeline.
